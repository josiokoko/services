Storage in Kubernetes
	- Sharing of data by containers in a Pod
	- Sharing of data by Pods 
	- Persisting data beyond the life cycle of a Pod

Volumes:
	(1) Ephemeral Volumes:
		- volume life cycle = the Pod life cycle
		- If a container restarts, the new container will have access to the same volume
		- Once Pod terminates, the volume is gone!

	(2) Persistent Volume 
		- Solves the challenges with ephemeral volume

Type of Volumes:
	(1) emtyDir()
		- an empty directory that is created when a Pod is assigned to a node
		- Only exists as long as the Pod exits
		- Containers can write to and read from it 
		- the same emptyDir() volume can be mounted on different path for different containers

	(11) hostPath:
		- Use to mount file or a directory from the host node's filesystem to a Pod

	(111) Persistent Volume:
			- Static PV
				- PersistentVolume object
				- PersistentVolumeClaim object
				- Create volumes and volumeMounts

			- Dynamic PV (Using Storage Class)
				- Storage Class
				- PersistentVolumeClaim object
				- Create volumes and volumeMount
		


Scenario (Logging):
	- Two apps
		- busybox app and outputting date log every 5 seconds
		- httpd app storing the date log
	
	- Create a multi-container Pod running the two apps.
