Services and Networking in k8s

- Setting up a k8s cluster:
		- kubeadm
		- kOps
		- EKS => AWS Elastic Kubernetes Services

		kOps vs EKS
		
		(1) kOps
			- You manage your control plane 
			- It's very easy to set up
			- Cost (largely comparable to EKS)
			- It's been around for longer
			- Degree of control on your cluster

		(2) EKS
			- AWS manages your control plane 
			- Extremely easy to set up
			- Relatively new tool 
			- Cost (comparable)
			- Less control
